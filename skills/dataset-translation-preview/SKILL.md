description: Draft read-only structured English-to-Vietnamese translation preview JSON for one AI-LAB literary chapter. Use when Codex, Claude, or another LLM agent must consume an already validated AI-LAB dataset chapter with known entities, glossary terms, entity relations/address policy, and chapter summary, then return per-block Vietnamese preview text plus the dataset context ids it used. This skill is experimental and must not write canonical dataset files, gold reference files, or app storage.

# Dataset Translation Preview

Use this skill to produce a **read-only translation preview** for one AI-LAB chapter. The output demonstrates how dataset metadata can guide translation, especially names, terms, relations, and Vietnamese address/xung-ho.

This skill does **not** create gold data. It must not write to `canonical/`, `manual_reference_subset.jsonl`, `working/drafts.json`, scratch outputs, or any project storage. Return JSON only.

## Required Context

Before drafting, read:

- `references/TRANSLATION_PREVIEW_CONTRACT.md` for input/output shape and hard rules.
- `examples/GOLD_DEMO_01_CH01_EXAMPLE.md` when you need a concrete expected pattern.

## Workflow

1. Read one chapter input JSON only. Do not translate a whole book in one call.
2. For each block, translate `clean_text` into Vietnamese literary prose.
3. Apply hard dataset context that is relevant to that block:
   - entity mentions: use `canonical_target` / target aliases consistently.
   - glossary terms: use `expected_target` and avoid `forbidden_variants`.
   - dialogue: use `discourse` speaker/addressee plus `known_relations.address_policy` when available.
   - chapter memory: use `chapter_summary` for tone and continuity, without adding explanation.
4. Distinguish glossary concepts from ordinary same-surface verbs or phrases. Do not blindly replace every matching string.
5. For each block, list `mentions`, `address_applied`, and `used_context` ids that were actually used.
6. Return exactly one JSON object matching the contract.

## Hard Rules

- Read-only preview only. Never write or promote gold/reference output.
- Do not emit spans, offsets, or annotation edits.
- Do not invent entity ids, term ids, relation ids, or summary ids not present in input.
- If a relation does not apply to the current speaker/addressee pair or phase, do not force it.
- If a term surface is being used as an ordinary verb/phrase rather than the glossary concept, translate the local meaning and explain briefly in `notes`.
- `target_surface` in `mentions` must be text that appears in `target_text`.
- `used_context` must contain only ids that influenced the block.
- Raw output is for comparison/debugging only and is not an AI-LAB dataset artifact.

## Output

Return only the preview JSON object. Do not wrap it in Markdown. Do not add prose before or after the JSON.
